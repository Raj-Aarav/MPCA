# MPCA - Microprocessors and Computer Architecture
- This repo contains files regarding the subject, microprocessors and computer architecture. It has assembly language codes (ARM).
- This repo contains ARM assembly language codes for various tasks.
- ARM assembly is used to program ARM architecture-based microcontrollers and processors.

# How to execute ARM assembly language codes :
1. To run and test the ARM assembly code, you will need an ARM simulator or an actual ARM-based device.
2. An easy to use simulator is ARMsim#, by University of Victoria. (https://webhome.cs.uvic.ca/~nigelh/ARMSim-V2.1/)
3. Then load the file in the simulator and run/execute step-by-step.
